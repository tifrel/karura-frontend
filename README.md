## How to fetch data from Karura

- [`acala.js`](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/acala.js/wiki): Querying the
  chain directly (?). I went with this option after having issues with using the
  SubQuery (outdated KSM price).
- [Karura SubQuery](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura):
  Probably the sweetspot, as it's low maintenance for the user and yields a load
  of readily aggregated data. Currently has issues and is thus not up-to-date.
- Self-rolled SubQuery: Most effort, but also most control. Custom aggregations
  take strain from the client-side. Reliability is basically defined by the
  provider and team behind the SubQuery project.

**Sorry random user, if this your address and you don't wish to see it here,
notice me and I will remove it asap!**
